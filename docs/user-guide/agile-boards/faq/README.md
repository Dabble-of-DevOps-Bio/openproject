# Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for Agile boards

## How can I display in a Kanban board which of my tasks are due in the next two weeks?

To do this, you can (provided you have set the end dates for the work packages) add the filter "finish date" to the Kanban board and select "In less than 15 days" there. Then you will see the tasks that have a finish date in less than 15 (i.e. 14 days or less).
